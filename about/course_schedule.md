## Lecture Learning Outcomes

1. Introduction to R and Review of Basic Statistics

	- understand purpose and usefulness of R and difference with Python
	- define different types of data: qualitative, quantitative
	- describe data use numerical summaries (measure of centre/spread)
	- define and calculate: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, range
	- define: quantile, quartile, interquartile range, five number summary	
	- install and use RStudio
	- set and get the working directory
	- list the different types of data structures in the R language
	- write small programs/commands in R that may use variables, conditions, loops, and functions
	- use R to determine the type and structure of an object

2. R Data Structures: Vectors, Lists, Matrices, and Data Frames

	- create, index, and subset vectors, lists, and matrices
	- generate vectors of random data
	- read in data sets from files
	- use head and tail to explore a data set
	- use data frames/factors for data analysis
	- explain what factors are and why they are useful
	- create graphs/visualizations: frequency table, bar chart, histogram, boxplot using base R and ggplot2
	
3. Python Introduction and Data Types

	- understand Python 2 and Python 3 have some syntax differences
	- follow Python syntax rules including indentation, variable naming, and comments
	- define and compare: algorithm, language, program, programming
	- list and explain when to use different Python data types
	- perform math expressions and understand operator precedence

	- perform printing to console for output	
	- use string and string functions including string indexing, subsetting, and concatenation
	- apply formatting for string output
	- use date and time functions
	- proficient in reading input from console and output results to console
	
4. Python Conditions and Loops

	- create comparisons and use them for decisions with if
	- combine conditions with and, or, not
	- make decisions using if/elif/else syntax
	- perform repetition using loop constructs for and while
		
5. Python Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Functions

	- create and use lists and list functions
	- understand advance syntax for list comprehensions, list slicing
	- create and use tuples and tuple functions
	- create and use dictionaries
	- explain the difference between tuples, lists, and dictionaries
	- create and use Python functions with parameters and return a value from a function
	- explain the benefit of using functions for program decomposition
	- use built-in functions and functions in the math library including generating random numbers
	- exposure to passing functions and lambda functions

6. Python File I/O and Exceptions

	- read URLs using urllib.request
	- explain the purpose of exceptions and exception handling
	- use try-except statement to handle exceptions and understand how each of try, except, else, finally blocks are used
	
7. Python Modules and Objects
	
	- use object-oriented terminology: class, object, method, parameter, instance variable, inheritance, superclass, subclass
	- create classes with methods
	- instantiate objects ; call methods and access object properties
	- know that Python supports inheritance when defining classes
